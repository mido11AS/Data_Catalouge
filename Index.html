            Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, whichleads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site.

            Bootstrap use jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

            <span>s</span>alinity, and wind variations can cause persistent high or low areas in the ocean. Thesedifferences are measurable, in places over ameter (3 feet), perhaps small on global scale,but large in local or regional analysis. We historically referenced heights to mean sea
            level, and many believe we still do, but this
            is no longer true for most spatial data analyses.
            Because we have two reference surfaces,
            a geiod and an ellipsoid, we also have
            two bases from which to measure height.
            Elevation is typically defined as the distance
            above a geoid. This height above a geoid is
            also called the orthometric height (Figure 3-
            9). Heights above an ellipsoid are often
            referred to as ellipsoidal height. These are
            illustrated in Figure 3-9, with the ellipsoidalheight labeled h, and orthometric height labeled H. The difference between the ellipsoidalheight and geoidal height at any location,shown in Figure 3-9 as N, has various
            names, including geoidal height and geoidal
            separation.
